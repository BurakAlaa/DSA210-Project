# DSA210-Project
Introduction
In this project, I aim to analyze the factors that impact my academic success and exam grades. I am planning to do this by tracking my study locations and recording the time of day I studied and relating these to my final exam grades.
Motivation
My primary motivations for this project are to determine the most effective study location for me, finding out the times of the days which I study the most effectively. Of course there may be various factors affecting my academic success but by the end of the project, I believe I will have a better understanding of what works for me better in terms of study location and the time of the day I study.
Methodology
For this project, I recorded a daily log of my study activities throughout the semester. Specifically, I recorded my study location and the time of the day I studied. 
Study location is either IC or my room. 
I split the time of the day I study into 5 time blocks:
•	Morning: 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM
•	Afternoon: 12:00 PM – 5:00 PM
•	Evening: 5:00 PM – 9:00 PM
•	Night: 9:00 PM – 12:00 AM
•	Late Night: 12:00 AM – 3:00 AM
I carefully noted the location and time block for each study session.
Data Analysis
I will analyze the data I collected to explore relationships between study location, time blocks, and exam performance. This includes identifying correlations between study habits and grades, assessing differences in performance across various locations and times, and finding out patterns or trends that could influence academic outcomes.
Hypothesis and Expected Outcomes
•	Null Hypothesis (H₀): Study location and time of day have no significant impact on my exam performance.
•	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
o	H₁a: Studying in my room leads to better exam performance compared to studying in the IC.
o	H₁b: Morning (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM) and afternoon (12:00 PM – 5:00 PM) are the most productive time blocks for achieving higher exam grades.
